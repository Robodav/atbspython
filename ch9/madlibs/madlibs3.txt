In a ADJECTIVE city 300 years in the future, all food has been replaced with NOUN. If anyone is caught trying to VERB in the streets, the ADJECTIVE police will inflict punishment upon them ADVERB. The citizens live their ADJECTIVE lives in misery, their only hope being the NOUN, who will VERB them from their struggles!
